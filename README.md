# IndieKit

This is @bmann's fork of [paulrobertlloyd/indiekit](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit). I couldn't get the config to work for me, so I'm hacking the templates directly, and it works great.

This powers the micropub endpoint for my personal blog at [blog.bmannconsulting.com](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com).

I am using indiekit instead of [voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github](https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github) because the indiekit code implements the media endpoint, so file uploads work, and the post templates here are very easy to work with.
